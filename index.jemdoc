== About Me
I am a second year Ph.D. student at the department of ISYE at Georgia Tech. I am particularly interested in Machine learning for Dynamic Networks. I have recently been focusing on developing learning algorithms for Hawkes Process Network model.
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/ Yao Xie]. 

In the past, I achieved my MS degree of ECE in Georgia Tech supervised by Prof. [https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/ Yao Xie]. And I completed my BS degree in Tsinghua University where I worked with Prof. [https://rapidthu.wixsite.com/home Shouyi Yin] exploring deep learning for image detection. During my undergraduate, I also worked with Prof. [http://async.usc.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7 Peter Beerel] on Resilient Circuit Network Optimization at University of Southern California as a summer intern. 

My updated [Resume_Minghe.pdf CV] can be found here.
